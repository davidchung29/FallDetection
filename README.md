# FallDetection
Used ResNet-50 to train a model to detect falls

Falls are the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths worldwide, with timely response times correlating to a higher chance of recovery from severe falls. Inspired by a personal experience of a severe fall, this study aims to address the problem by developing a highly accurate fall detection model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In pursuit of improved performance over traditional CNNs, we harnessed the ResNet-50, which has more layers than a traditional CNN. This model was primed with the ResNet50_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V2, a set of pretrained weights optimized for image detection. Moreover, it underwent supplementary pretraining on the UCF-101 action dataset, which encompasses 101 distinct actions, followed by dedicated training for fall detection using the E-FPDS fall dataset. A Lambda Labs eGPU was used for accelerated processing for both pretraining on the UCF-101 dataset and for training on the E-FPDS fall detection dataset. This study's findings indicate a remarkable 99.5% accuracy in detecting falls. These results hold implications for developing more accurate fall detection systems, promoting public health and safety. Future endeavors involve the integration of this model into security cameras for implementation within local communities.
